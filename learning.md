# dotdotdot: A Fast-Track Programming Project

This is a project-based programming course where attendees will be fast-tracked
to familiarity with modern, industry-standard, collaborative approaches to
software development.

## Learning Goals

1. Write Python code designed to be read by others and extended upon in the future.
2. Debug, test, and document Python code that has been written by yourself and others.
3. Collaborate and develop code with others using `git` and `GitHub`

## Learning Outcomes

1. Immediately after this course, attendees will be able will be able to:
    - write command-line helper tools in Python using libraries like `click`
    - manipulate images in Python using libraries like `opencv2`, `pillow`, and
      `numpy`
2. One month after this course, attendees will be able to:
    - write and evaluate tests in Python using tools like `pytest`
    - write effective documentation, docstrings, and comments for Python code
    - find, identify, and triage bugs in Python code
3. Three months after this course, attendees will be able to collaborate more
   effectively by using:
    - `git` to create commits, branches, push/pull from remote machines
    - GitHub to fork projects, manage branches, open Pull Requests and Issues to collaborate with others.

## Skills

The course will cover skills such as (but not limited to):

- use of Git: `git clone`, `git pull`, `git push`, `git remote`, `git stash`, `git merge`, `git rebase -i` (basic squashing)
    - dealing with merge conflicts
- working collaboratively
    - writing a good Github Issues
    - basic design discussions, communicating via Github Issues
    - writing good commit messages
    - writing good Pull Request messages
    - responding to requested changes when preparing a PR
    - writing draft PRs with WIP commits
    - writing good bug reports
- command-line development
    - use of tools such as `mypy`, `flake8`, `black`
    - writing shell-script based tests & PyTest unit tests
    - writing `Makefile`s for automation
    - using command-line editors such as `nano`, `vim`, or `emacs`
    - using associated tooling such as `tmux` or `screen`
- working with deployment and container tooling
    - writing, building `Containerfile`s
    - running images
    - Ansible playbooks
- shell & Python scripting concepts
    - use of libraries like `numpy`, `PIL`, `cv2`
    - use of libraries like `tempfile`, `Path`, `subprocess`
    - managing dependencies with `python -m venv`, `python -m pip install`, `python -m pip freeze`
    - writing good docstrings
    - writing good comments
    - writing basic annotations (for `mypy`)
    - using basic shell-scripting mechanisms such as redirection, piping, and forking
